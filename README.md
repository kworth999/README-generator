### Description
This project involved creating a Node.js application that utilizes the 'Inquirer' package to ask the user a series of prompts that then feed into a templated README document. The goal of the application is to quickly produce a professional README file for projects that always has the appropriate formatting and minimum required content. It utilizes several confirmation prompts and conditional questions based on those prompts to ensure your README has the content you need.

### Installation

### Usage

1. Navigate to the corresponding directory in your terminal
2. Run node index.js
3. Input the appropriate content for each prompt
4. Enjoy your freshly-minted README file
